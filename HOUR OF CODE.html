             <h1>Information About The Project</h1>
             <p>The Hour of Code is a one-hour introduction to computer science with the goal of explaining "code" and demonstrating that anyone can learn the fundamentals, and increase engagement in the subject. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate that teaching computer science can be enjoyable, innovative, and available for students of all ages and backgrounds. The virtual “Hour of Code” event will be held at Secondary School No.46 at Baku, Azerbaijan by team members

                Team members will launch the event with an introduction about ADA University followed by an informative session about computer science and its fields. Subsequently, a brief question and answering session will be provided if students have any query regarding ADA University, computer science and programming. After wrapping up an explanation part about “Hour of Code” event, team members and participants will start to utilize the Code.org website’s “Classic Maze” puzzles to practice programming by blocks. Natavan Hasanova who was selected as a tutor will explain every new function in all the tasks by showing the puzzles through the projector. In the meantime, other team members will offer assistance by aiding individual students in keeping up with the pace, shooting photographs or videos, and so on.
                
                It is planned that 20 tasks in total as well as Mark Zuckerberg’s, Bill Gates’s and other individual’s motivational videos will be shared by the organizers. The students who will accomplish the highest number of tasks assigned in a period of time by team members, will rank 1st, 2nd, and 3rd places, respectively. Participants, the instructor, and team members will express their perspectives on the significance of this event for students. At the conclusion of the event, the students who accomplish all 20 assignments will receive official Code.org certificates.</p>
